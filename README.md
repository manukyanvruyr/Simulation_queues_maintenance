Customers (i.e. customer objects) arrive in random integer intervals of 1-4 minutes, also, each customer is served in random integers intervals of 1-4 minutes.
Run the supermarket simulation for a 2-hour period (120 minutes) and print the following info: 

What is the maximum number of customers in the queue at any time?
What is the longest wait of customer?
What happens if the arrival interval is changed from 1-4 minutes to 1-3 minutes?
